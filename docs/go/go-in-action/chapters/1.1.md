第一章 Go语言介绍
=================

本章解决如下问题:
1. 使用Go语言解决现代计算挑战
2. 使用go命令

计算机已经进化了，但是编程语言并没有跟上进化步伐。我们携带的手机都可以拥有比我们使用的第一台电脑更多的核。高功率服务器现在都有64，128甚至更高的核，但是我们仍然使用过去我们使用的单核技术来编程。

编程艺术也进化了。 很多程序也不再由单个开发者实现的了: 由坐在不同时区不同时间的团队成员实现。大项目被拆分成小片分配给程序员，然后由程序员将他们的工作以类库或包的形式传回团队, 而且这些类库和包可以跨越应用的整个包可用。

当今的程序员和公司比以往更相信开源软件的强大。Go是一种让代码分享变得更容易的语言。Go附带工具可以使得使用其他人写的包变得更简单，Go也更加容易共享自己的包。

本章你会看到Go和其他语言的不同之处。Go反思你可能使用的传统面向对象开发, 同时仍然提供有效的代码复用方式。Go更容易有效使用你的昂贵服务器的多核特性，这样能大大降低大型项目的编译代价。

阅读本章的过程中，你会感觉到Go的创造适合很多决定，从它的并发模型到快速编译。我们在序言中有提到过，但值得重复: 本书是为具有一些其他编程语言经验并且想学Go语言的中级开发人员所写。我们写本书的目标是为你提供强化、全面和真实的语言观。我们专注于语言规范和实现，包括语言语法、Go类型系统、并发、通道、测试等多方面的主题。我们相信本书对于那些想要跳跃性学习Go语言或者希望彻底理解语言和其内核的人都是完美的。


As you read this chapter, you’ll get a feeling for the many decisions that shaped the creation of Go, from its concurrency model to its lightning-fast compiler. We mentioned it in the preface, but it bears repeating: this book has been written for an intermediate-level developer who has some experience with other programming lan- guages and wants to learn Go. Our goal in writing this book is to provide you an inten- sive, comprehensive, and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including the wide-ranging topics of language syntax, Go’s type system, concurrency, channels, testing, and more. We believe this book is perfect for anyone who wants a jump-start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals.
The source code for the examples in the book is available at https://github.com/ goinaction/code.
We hope you’ll appreciate the tools that ship with Go to make your life as a devel- oper easier. In the end, you’ll appreciate why so many developers are choosing Go when they start up that new project.


## 1.1 使用Go语言来解决现代编程挑战

The Go team went to great lengths to solve the problems facing software developers today. Developers have to make an uncomfortable choice between rapid development and performance when choosing a language for their projects. Languages like C and C++ offer fast execution, whereas languages like Ruby and Python offer rapid develop- ment. Go bridges these competing worlds and offers a high-performance language with features that make development fast.
As we explore Go, you’ll find well-planned features and concise syntax. As a lan- guage, Go is defined not only by what it includes, but by what it doesn’t include. Go has a concise syntax with few keywords to memorize. Go has a compiler that’s so fast, sometimes you’ll forget it’s running. As a Go developer, you’ll spend significantly less time waiting for your project to build. Because of Go’s built-in concurrency features, your software will scale to use the resources available without forcing you to use spe- cial threading libraries. Go uses a simple and effective type system that takes much of the overhead out of object-oriented development and lets you focus on code reuse. Go also has a garbage collector, so you don’t have to manage your own memory. Let’s look quickly at these key features.
